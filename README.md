# NodeJS Electron Photobooth for DSLR Cameras

## Gettng Started
 - Install Node 12 - suggest using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
 - Install [gphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/)

 - `npm start`

All captured photos will land in a `captures` directory in the root of the project.

Any DSLR that support live preview and capturing images in gphoto2 should work with this app.
